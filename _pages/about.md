Welcome.  My name is David Johnson and I am a research scientist with interest integrating human computer interaction (HCI) and interaction design methods to the field of machine learning for interaction AI, with a focus on sound, and computing in the arts (CITA). The aim of my research is to foster Augmented Intelligence in which human can augment machine capabilities and vice versa, the machine can augment human capabilities. With the current black-box nature of learning systems, collaboration between human and machine will help improve the trust between the two systems.

Currently, I am a research scientist at the <a href="https://www.idmt.fraunhofer.de/en.html"> Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technololgy (IDMT) </a>, where my research focuses on the application of audio signal processing and deep learning, or machine listening, for Industrial Sound Analysis (ISA). 
The goal of ISA is to identify new acoustic-based methods to improve industrial processes and enable automation, in use cases such as predictive maintenance and product end-of-line testing (quality control). 
The research covers a wide breadth of topics within the field of machine listening, including learning from limited data, anomalous sound detection, audio event detection, and federated learning. 

Before joining the IDMT I completed my PhD at the  <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/">University of Victoria </a> under the supervision of <a href="http://webhome.csc.uvic.ca/~gtzan/index.html"> Dr. George Tzanetakis </a> and <a href="http://thesegalgroup.org/people/daniela-damian/"> Dr. Daniela Damian </a>, where I performed research at the intersection of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Music Information Retrieval (MIR), Computer Vision (CV) and Extended Reality (XR) for improving musical tutoring. I completed my MSC at the <a href="https://compsci.cofc.edu/"> College of Charleston </a> working with <a href="http://blogs.cofc.edu/manaris/"> Dr. Bill Manaris </a>. There I performed research in the application of HCI and Genetic Algorithms for tools to enhance the creative process of musicians and artists.
